  Let $BC$ be the tower, $A$ the point of observation and $\theta$ as angle of elevation.

  Since the tower is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at $B$. Thus,

  $\tan\theta = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{100\sqrt{3}}{100} = \sqrt{3} \Rightarrow \theta = 60^\circ$.

  Let $BC$ be the tower, $A$ the point of observation and the angle of elevation is $30^\circ$.

  Since the tower is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at $B$. Thus,

  $\tan30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AB} \Rightarrow BC = 30.\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = 10\sqrt{3}$ m.

  Let $BC$ be the height of kite, $AC$ be the length of string the angle of elevation is $60^\circ$.

  Since the kite would be vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at $B$. Thus,

  $\sin60^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = \frac{60.2}{\sqrt{3}} = 40\sqrt{3}$ m.

  Let $BC$ be the height of kite, $AC$ be the length of string the angle of elevation is $60^\circ$.

  Since the kite would be vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at $B$. Thus,

  $\sin60^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow BC = 100\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}= 50\sqrt{3}$ m.

  Let $BC$ be the pole, $A$ the point where rope is tied to the ground and the angle of elevation is $30^\circ$.

  Since the pole is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at $B$. Thus,

  $\sin30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = \frac{12}{\sin30^\circ} = 24$ m.

  Thus, the acrobat has to climb $24$ m.

  Let $BC$ be the pole, $A$ the point where rope is tied to the ground and the angle of elevation is $30^\circ$.

  Since the pole is vertical it forms a right-angle triangle with right angle at $B$. Thus,

  $\sin30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow BC = 20.\frac{1}{2} = 10$ m.

  Let the shaded region represent the river and vertical lines the banks. $AB$ represents the bridge, making an angle of
  $45^\circ$ with the bank. Let $BC$ represent the width of river, which clearly makes a right angle triangle with
  right angle at $C$.

  Clearly, $\sin45^\circ = \frac{BC}{AB} \Rightarrow BC = 150.\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 75\sqrt{2}$ m.

  Thus, width of the river is $74\sqrt{2}$ meters.

  Let $AB$ be the observer, $1.5$ m tall. $CE$ be the tower. Draw line $BD$ parallel to $AC$ which
  will make $CD = 1.5$ m. In right angle triangle $BDE$ angle of elevation $\angle B = 45^\circ$. Given,
  $BD = 28.5$ m. Thus,

  $\tan45^\circ = \frac{DE}{BD} \Rightarrow DE = 28.5$ m. $\therefore CE = CD + DE = 1.5 + 28.5 = 30$ m.

  $BD$ is the pole and $AC$ is the ladder. $C$ is the point which the electrician need to reach to repair the
  pole which is $1.3$ m below the top of the pole. Total height of the pole is $4$ m, thus, $BC = 4 - 1.3 =
  2.7$ m.

  We are given than ladder makes an angle of $60^\circ$ with the horizontal.

  $\therefore \sin60^\circ = \frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = \frac{BC}{\sin60^\circ} = \frac{2.7\sqrt{3}}{2} = 3.12$ m.

  the height of the water tank above the tower. Given $AB = 40$ m .

  In $\triangle ABC, \tan30^\circ = \frac{BC}{AB} \Rightarrow BC = AB.\tan30^\circ = \frac{40}{\sqrt{3}} = 23.1$ m,
  which is height of the toweer.

  In $\triangle ABD, \tan45\circ = \frac{BD}{AB} \Rightarrow BD = AB.\tan45^\circ = 40.1 = 40$ m which is combined height
  of the tower and water tank. Thus, height or depth of the water tank $= CD = BD - BC = 40 - 23.1 = 16.9$ m.

  In $\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \frac{h}{x} \Rightarrow h = \sqrt{3}x$

  In $\triangle ABD \tan30^\circ = \frac{h}{x + 20}\Rightarrow \sqrt{3}h = x + 20$

  $\Rightarrow 3x = x + 20 \Rightarrow x = 10$ m. $\Rightarrow h = 10\sqrt{3}$ m.

  of the tree is given as $12$ m.

  In $\triangle ABD, \sin60^\circ = \frac{x}{12 - x} \Rightarrow \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{x}{12 - x} \Rightarrow x = 5.57$

  original height of the tree.

  In $\triangle ABD, \sin30^\circ = \frac{x}{l - x} = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow 3x = l$

  $\cos30^\circ = \frac{30}{l - x} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \Rightarrow x = 17.32 \Rightarrow l = 51.96$ m.

  In $\triangle ABC, \tan\beta = \frac{3}{4} = \frac{h}{x}$

  In $\triangle ABD, \tan\alpha = \frac{5}{12} = \frac{h}{x + 192} \Rightarrow h = 180$ meters.

  In $\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \frac{1200}{x} \Rightarrow x = \frac{1200}{sqrt{3}} = 400\sqrt{3}$ m.

  In $\triangle ABC, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1200}{x + d} \Rightarrow x + d = 1200\sqrt{3} \Rightarrow d = 800\sqrt{3}$ m.

  from $D$. Angle of elevations are given as $30^\circ$ and $60^\circ$.

  In $\triangle ACE, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{h}{x}\Rightarrow h = \sqrt{3}x$.

  $CD = x$ m.

  In $\triangle ABC, \tan45^\circ = 1 = \frac{100}{y} \Rightarrow y = 100$.

  In $\triangle ABD, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{100}{x + y} = \frac{100}{100 + x} \Rightarrow x = 73.2$ m.

  The diagram represents the top $PQ$ and $XY$ as given in the problem. The angle of elevations are also given. Draw
  $YZ$ parallel to $ZQ$ and thus, $PZ = 40$ m. Let $ZQ = x$.

  In $\triangle QYZ, \tan45^\circ = 1 = \frac{ZQ}{YZ} \Rightarrow YZ = x$ m. Thus, $PX = x$ m.

  In $\triangle PQX, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{x + 40}{x} \Rightarrow x = \frac{40}{\sqrt{3} - 1}$ m.

  Height of toewr is $x + 40 = \frac{40\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}$

  In $\triangle PQX, \sin60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{PQ}{XQ} \Rightarrow XQ = \frac{80}{\sqrt{3} - 1}$ m.

  Let $AB$ and $CD$ are the houses. Given $CD = 15$ m. Let the width of the street is $AC = ED = x$ m. The
  angle of depression and elevation are given as $45^\circ$ and $30^\circ$ respectively. Draw $ED\parallel AC$.

  In $\triangle ACD, \tan45^\circ = 1 = \frac{CD}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = 15$ m. Thus, $ED$ is also $15$ m because
  $ED$ is paralle to $AC$.

  In $\triangle BED, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{BE}{ED} \Rightarrow BE = 5\sqrt{3}$ m.

  The angles of depression are given which would be same as angle of elevation from top and bottom of tower.

  In $\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{60}{x} \Rightarrow x = 20\sqrt{3}$ m.

  In $\triangle ADE, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{BE}{x}\Rightarrow BE = 20$ m.

  The angle of elevation are shown as given in the question.

  In $\triangle ACD, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{CD}{x} \Rightarrow x = 10\sqrt{3}$ m.

  In $\triangle BDC, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{BE}{x} \Rightarrow BE = 30$ m.

  Thus, height of the hill $= AE + BE = 10 + 30 = 40$ m.

  Let $CE$ be the line in which plane is flying and $ABD$ be the horizontal ground. Since the plane is flying at a
  constant height of $3600\sqrt{3}$ m, we have $BC = DE = 3600\sqrt{3}$ m. Let $AB = x$ m and $BD = y$ m.

  In $\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{3600\sqrt{3}}{x} \Rightarrow x = 3600$ m.

  In $\triangle ADE, \tan40^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3600\sqrt{3}}{x + y} \Rightarrow y = 7200$ m.

  Thus, the plane flies $7200$ m in $30$ s. Speed of plane $= \frac{7200}{30}.\frac{3600}{1000} = 284$ km/hr.

  In $\triangle BDE, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{BE}{140} \Rightarrow BE = \frac{140}{\sqrt{3}}$ m.

  Thus, total height of first tower is $\frac{140}{\sqrt{3}} + 60$ m.

  In $\triangle ACD, \tan60^\circ = \frac{CD}{AD} \Rightarrow AD = 87/\sqrt{3}$ m.

  In $\triangle AFG, \tan30^\circ = \frac{FG}{AG} \Rightarrow AG = 87\sqrt{3}$ m.

  Let $AB$ represent the tower with a height $h$. Let $C$ and $D$ be the points to which angles of
  depression are given as $60^\circ$ and $30^\circ$ which are shown as angles of elevation at these points.

  In $\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{AB}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = h/\sqrt{3}$

  In $\triangle ABD, \tan30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{AB}{AD} \Rightarrow AD = h\sqrt{3}$

  $CD = AD - AC = 2h/\sqrt{3}$

  The car covers the distance $CD$ in six seconds. Thus speed of the car if $2h/(6\sqrt{3}) = h/3\sqrt{3}$

  Time taken to cover $AC$ to reach the foot of the tower is $\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}\times\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{h} = 3$

  Let $AB$ be the building having height $h$ m. Let $C$ and $D$ be the fire stations from which the

  In $\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \sqrt{3} = \frac{AB}{AC}\Rightarrow AC = h/\sqrt{3}$ m.

  In $\triangle ABD, \tan45^\circ = h = \frac{AB}{AD}\Rightarrow AD = h$ m.

  Since $AD < AD$ so the fire station at $C$ will reach the building faster.

  $AD = AC + CD \Rightarrow h = h/\sqrt{3} + 20000 \Rightarrow h = \frac{20000\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}$

  In $\triangle BDE, \tan45^\circ = DE/BD \Rightarrow BD = x$ m.

  In $\triangle, \tan30^circ = CD/BD \Rightarrow BD = 10\sqrt{3} = x$

  Thus, $CE = 10 + 10\sqrt{3} = 27.32$ m.

  In $\triangle ABC, \tan60^\circ = \frac{AB}{AC} \Rightarrow w = \frac{50}{\sqrt{3}} = DE[\because DE||AC]$

  In $\triangle BDE, \tan30^\circ = \frac{BD}{DE} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{BD}{50/\sqrt{3}}\Rightarrow BD =

  In $\triangle BDE, \tan15^\circ = \frac{DE}{BD} \Rightarrow DE = 1830.6$ m.

  This is a problem similar to previous problem with $2500$ replaced by $h$ and angles are replaced by
  $\alpha$ and $\beta$. So the diagram is similar in nature. Let the height of the cloud above lake be

  In $\triangle BDE, \tan\alpha = \frac{DE}{BD}\Rightarrow BD = (h' - h)/\tan\alpha$

  In $\triangle BDF, \tan\beta = \frac{DF}{BD}\Rightarrow BD = (h' + h)/\tan\beta$

  $\Rightarrow (h' - h)\tan\beta = (h' + h)\tan\alpha \Rightarrow h' = \frac{h(\tan\alpha + \tan\beta)}{\tan\beta -

  $\therefore BD = \frac{2h}{(\tan\alpha - \tan\beta)}$

  In $\triangle BED, \tan\theta = \frac{4}{3} = \frac{150 - h}{d} \Rightarrow 4d = 450 - 3h$

  In $\triangle ACD, \tan\phi = \frac{5}{2} = \frac{150}{d} \Rightarrow d = 60$ m.

  $\Rightarrow h = 70$ m. $\Rightarrow BE = 60$ m and $ED = 150 - 70 = 80$ m.

  $BD^2 = BE^2 + DE^2 = 80^2 + 60^2 \Rightarrow BD = 100$ m, which, is the distance between the tops

  \angle CAB = 90^\circ$.

  In $\triangle ACD, \tan 30^\circ = \frac{h}{AC} \Rightarrow AC = h\sqrt{3}$

  In $\triangle BCD,, \tan18^\circ = \frac{h}{BC} \Rightarrow BC = h\cot18^\circ$

  In $\triangle ABC, BC^2 = a^2 + AC^2 \Rightarrow h^2\cot^218^\circ = a^2 + 3h^2$

  $\therefore h = \frac{a}{\sqrt{\cot^218^\circ - 3}}$

  $\phi$ as given in the question.

  Thus, $\angle APB = \angle AQB = \theta$ and $\angle ARB = \phi$.

  In $\triangle APB, \tan\theta = \frac{h}{AP} \Rightarrow AP = h\cot\theta$

  Similarly, $AQ = h\cot\theta$ and $AR = h\cot\phi$

  $\because AR$ is the median of the $\triangle APQ$

  $\therefore AP^2 + AQ^2 = 2PR^2 + 2AR^2$

  $\Rightarrow 2h^2\cot^2\theta = 2a^2 + 2h^2\cot^2\phi$

  $\Rightarrow h^(\cot^2\theta - \cot^2\phi) = a^2$

  Similalrly, $AR = h\cot\beta$ and $AQ = h\cot\gamma$

  Also, $PR = QR = 1$ mile.

  $\because PR = QR, AR$ is the median of the triangle $APR$.

  Let $OP$ be the tower haing a height of $h$ which is to be found. Let $ABC$ be the
  equilateral triangle. Given that $OP$ subtends angles of $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ at
  $A, B, C$ respectively. Given that $\tan\alpha = \sqrt{3} + 1$ and $\tan\beta =
  \tan\gamma = \sqrt{2}$. It is given that $OP$ is perpendicular to the plane of $\triangle
  ABC$.

  In $\triangle AOP, \tan\alpha = \frac{h}{OA} \Rightarrow \sqrt{3} + 1 = \frac{h}{OA} \Rightarrow
  OA = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3} + 1}$

  Similarly, $OB = OC = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2}}$

  In $\triangle AOB$ and $AOC$, $AB = AC, OB = OC, OA$ is common. $\therefore
  \triangle AOB$ and $\triangle AOC$ are equal.

  $\therefore \angle OAB = \angle OAC$ but $\angle BAC = 60^\circ$

  $\Rightarrow \angle OAB = \angle OAC = 30^\circ$

  Using sine rule in the $\triangle OAB, \frac{OB}{\sin30^\circ} = \frac{OA}{\sin\theta}$ (let
  $\angle ABO = \theta$)

  $\Rightarrow \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{2}}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3} + 1}}{\sin\theta}$

  $\Rightarrow \sin\theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{2\sqrt{2}} = \sin15^\circ$

  $\Rightarrow \theta = 15^\circ$

  $\Rightarrow \angle OBD = \angle ABC - \theta = 45^\circ$

  In $\triangle BOC, OB=OC, OD\perp BC \therefore BD = DC = 40'$

  In $\triangle OBD, \cos45^\circ = \frac{BD}{OB} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} =

  In the diagram we have shown only one tower instead of three. We will apply cyclic formula to this one
  tower relationships. Let $P$ be the position of the eye and height of $PQ = x$. Let
  $AB$ be the tower having a height of $a$ as given in the question and let the angle
  subtended by $AB$ at $P$ is $\theta$.

  Thus, $\angle APB = \theta, \angle PAQ = \alpha \Rightarrow \angle ABP = 180^\circ - \theta -
  (90^\circ - \alpha) = 90^\circ + (\alpha - \theta)$

  By sine rule in $\triangle APB$,

  $\frac{a}{\sin\theta} = \frac{AP}{\sin[90^\circ + (\alpha - \theta)]} = \frac{AP}{\cos(\alpha -
    \theta)}$

  In $\triangle APQ, \sin\alpha = \frac{x}{AP} \Rightarrow AP = \frac{x}{\sin\alpha}$

  $\Rightarrow \frac{a}{\sin\theta} = \frac{x}{\sin\alpha\cos(\alpha - \theta)}$

  $\Rightarrow x\sin\theta = a\sin\alpha\cos(\alpha - \theta)\Rightarrow \cos(\alpha - \theta) =
  \frac{x\sin\theta}{a\sin\alpha}$

  If we consider the other two towers we will have similar relations i.e.

  $\Rightarrow \cos(\beta - \theta) = \frac{x\sin\theta}{b\sin\beta}$ and $\cos(\gamma -
  \theta) = \frac{x\sin\theta}{c\sin\gamma}$

  Now, $\frac{\sin(\beta - \gamma)}{a\sin\alpha} + \frac{\sin(\gamma - \alpha)}{b\sin\beta} +
  \frac{\sin(\alpha - \beta)}{c\sin\gamma}$

  $=\displaystyle\sum\frac{\sin(\alpha - \beta)}{c\sin\gamma} =

  Also, $\angle PQR = \angle PRS = \theta$ (let). Let $PQ = x$.

  Clearly $\angle SRQ = \theta + \beta$

  Using sine law in $\triangle PRQ, \frac{x}{\sin\beta} = \frac{PR}{\sin\theta} \Rightarrow x =
  \frac{PR\sin\beta}{\sin\theta}$

  Using sine law in $\triangle PRS, \frac{PR}{\sin\alpha} = \frac{c}{\sin(\theta + \beta)}
  \Rightarrow PR = \frac{c\sin\alpha}{\sin(\theta + \beta)}$

  $\Rightarrow x = \frac{c\sin\alpha\sin\beta}{\sin(\theta + \beta)\sin(\theta)} =
  \frac{2c\sin\alpha\sin\beta}{2\sin(\theta + \beta)\sin(\theta)}$

  $= \frac{2c\sin\alpha\sin\beta}{\cos\beta - \cos(2\theta + \beta)}$

  In $\triangle QRS, \alpha + \beta + 2\theta = 180^\circ \Rightarrow 2\theta + \beta = 180^\circ -
  \alpha$

  height of $x$. $A$ and $B$ are the two points on the horizontal line $OA$. Let
  $OB = y$. Given, $AB = d, \angle QAP = \angle QBP = \alpha$.

  Since $\angle QAP = \angle QBP$, a circle will pass through the points $A, B, P$ and
  $Q$ because angles in the same segment of a circle are equal.

  Thus, $\angle BAP = \angle BQP = \beta$ (angles on the same segment $BP$)

  $\Rightarrow \angle BPO = \angle QAO = \alpha + \beta$

  In $\triangle AOP, \tan\beta = \frac{h}{y + d}$

  In $\triangle BOP, \tan(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{y}{h} \Rightarrow y = h\tan(\alpha + \beta)$

  $\Rightarrow h = y\tan\beta + d\tan\beta\Rightarrow h = \frac{d\tan\beta}{1 - \tan(\alpha +
    \beta)\tan\beta}$

  In $\triangle BOQ, \tan\beta = \frac{y}{x + h}\Rightarrow x\tan\beta + h\tan\beta =
