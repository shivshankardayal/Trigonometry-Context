\item Consider the following diagram:

  As you can see the value of $\sin$ is greater than $\frac{1}{2}$ between $30^\circ$ and $150^\circ$.

  So the general solution will be $2n\pi + \frac{\pi}{6} < x < 2n\pi + \frac{5\pi}{6}$ where $n = 0, \pm1,
  \pm 2., \ldots$.
\item When $\cos x = -\frac{1}{2}$ it is satisfied for $x = \frac{2\pi}{3}, \frac{4\pi}{3}$.

  $\Rightarrow 2n\pi - \frac{2\pi}{3}\leq x\leq 2n\pi + \frac{2\pi}{3}$, where $n = 0, \pm 1, \pm2, \ldots$.
