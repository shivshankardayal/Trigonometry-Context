\chapter{Graph of Trigonometric Functions}

Graphs of functions give us idea about the nature of functions. As you must have drawn graphs of algebraic
functions or linear equations similarly we draw the graph of trigonometric functions. One of the advantages
of plotting graphs of trigonometric functions is that we can find values of artbitrary angles using the
graph; while it is possible to calculate such values using the function definitions for algebraic functions
it is much harder to do the same for trigionometric functions.
