\chapter{Height and Distance}
There are problems where distances between two points are not directly measurable or difficult. Most of such problems can be solved
by applying trigonometric ratios with ease. This chapter is dependent on application of what we have studied so far about
trigonometric ratios.

\item {\bf Angle of Elevation:}

  Let $O$ and $P$ be two points, where $P$ is at a higher level than $O$. Also let $O$ be the
  position of observer and $P$ the position of the object. Draw a horizontal line  $OM$ through the point
  $O$. $OP$ is called the line of observation or line of sight. Then $\angle POM = \theta$ is called the angle
  of elevation of $P$ as observed from $O$.
\item {\bf Angle of Depression}

  \startplacefigure
    \externalfigure[27_2.pdf]
  \stopplacefigure

  In the above example, if $P$ be at a lower level than $O$, then $\angle MOP = \theta$ is called the angle of
  depression.

\item  {\bf Bearing}

  In the above example, if the observer and the object i.e. $O$ and $P$ be on the same level then bearing is
  defined. Four standard directions; East, West, North and South are taken as cardinal directions for measuring bearing. If
  $\angle POE = \theta$ is the bearing of point $P$ with respect to $O$ measured from East to North.

  North-east means equally inclines to north and east. South-east means equally inclines to south and east. E-N-E means
  equally inclined to east and north-east.

\section{Some Useful Properties of a Circle}
\startplacefigure

Angles on the same segment of a circle are equal. Alternatively, we can say that if the angles
$APB$ and $AQB$ subtended on the segment $AB$ are equal, a circle will pass through the
points $A, B, P$ and $Q$ i.e. these points are concyclic.

\startplacefigure
  \externalfigure[27_5.pdf]
\stopplacefigure

If $AR$ be the tangent to the circle passing through $P, Q$ and $R$ then $\angle
PRA = \angle PQR = \theta$

Also, if $PQ$ subtends greatest angle at $R$ which lies on the line $AR$, then point
$R$ will be the point of contact of the tangent to the circle passing through $P, Q$ and
$R$.
